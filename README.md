# calculate-pi-3blue1brown-python

This repository contains Python code that simulates the Pi Day Collisions as shown in the 3Blue1Brown YouTube video. The simulation uses Pygame for animation and follows the concept of colliding blocks to estimate the value of Pi.

##Requirements

To run the simulation, you need to have the following installed:

    Python (version 3 or later)
    Pygame library

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/calculate-pi-3blue1brown-python.git
```
Install Pygame using pip:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
## Usage
After completing the installation steps, navigate to the project directory and run the simulation by executing the following command:
```bash
python simulate.py  
```
 
The simulation window will open, and you will see the collision of blocks to estimate the value of Pi. The count of collisions
and the current estimate of Pi will be displayed on the window.
